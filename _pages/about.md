Abstract
------
Recent years have witnessed the emerging of conversational systems, including both physical devices and mobile-based applications. Both the research community and industry believe that conversational systems will have a major impact on human-computer interaction, and specifically, the RecSys community has begun to
explore Conversational Recommendation Systems. Conversational recommendation aims at finding or recommending the most relevant information (e.g., web pages, answers, movies, products) for users based on textual- or spoken-dialogs, through which users can communicate with the system more efficiently using natural language conversations. Due to usersâ€™ constant need to look for information to support both work and daily life, conversational recommendation system will be one of the key techniques towards an intelligent web. The tutorial focuses on the foundations and algorithms for conversational recommendation, as well as their applications in real-world systems such as search engine, e-commerce and social networks. The tutorial aims at introducing and communicating conversational recommendation methods to the community, as well as gathering researchers and practitioners interested in this research direction for discussions, idea communications, and research promotions.

[Zuohui Fu]() is a Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at Rutgers University, jointly advised by Prof. Yongfeng Zhang and Prof. Gerard de Melo. His research interests focus on solving the cutting-edge research problems over Information Retrieval, Natural
Language Processing and Machine Learning, with the emphasis on semantic matching, dialogue systems, and decision making over knowledge graphs, etc. His recent research mainly aims at knowledge graph assisted explainable, fair and conversational recommender system. His works have appeared in premier IR and artificial intelligenceconferences including AAAI, SIGIR, WWW, IJCAI, ACL, etc. Besides, he has served as the conference PC member in NeurIPS, AAAI, ACL, EMNLP, CIKM, etc., and the journal reviewer for ACM TOIS, etc.

[Yikun Xian]() is a Ph.D. student at the Department of Computer Science of Rutgers University, jointly advised by Prof. Yongfeng Zhang and Prof. Shan Muthukrishnan. His research interest broadly lies in the intersection of information retrieval and machine learning. His recent research include graph-based explainable decisionmaking problems with applications to explainable recommendation, knowledge-enhanced and explainable conversational recommendation, as well as interpretable comparative shopping. He mainly develops machine learning techniques such as graph-based reasoning, neural symbolic reasoning and deep reinforcement learning for information retrieval and recommender systems. He has served as PC member/reviewer in top computer science conference/journals such as NeurIPS, EMNLP, CIKM, SIGIR, ECML-PKDD, WWW, ECIR, RecSys, and ACM TOIS.
